    <h1>LEASE PLACE FOR HELP!</h1>
    <p>Climate-related disasters are frequent and severe, but there is encouraging evidence that we can prepare for and manage them. If we look back to South Asia’s Cyclone Bhola in 1970 or Hurricane Katrina in the United States in 2005, we see disasters that cost thousands of lives and inflicted damage in the billions. By comparison, some recent storms – Cyclone Fani in 2019 and last month’s Hurricane Ida – have hit communities hard but caused far less damage to lives and economies.

        While no two disasters are the same, we can do more today to increase preparedness, reduce impacts, and support a resilient recovery.  Key actions can make a difference for the people and communities that are in the eye of natural disasters. <br> The poorer a community is, the more vulnerable it is to natural hazards and climate change. Today, disasters push 26 million people into poverty each year.  For farm families with limited savings, a flood or drought that ruins crops is economically devastating. And this is both in the short term – with lost income reducing access to food and other necessities – and the longer term, as effects on education and health limit children’s horizons for a lifetime.

        Inclusive development and poverty reduction are essential to protecting the poor from disasters. Improving access to financial, technical, and institutional resources will make them better able to respond to climate change. In fact,Adaptation is a struggle for households and for the small firms that power local economies in developing economies. They have incentives to adapt – families and entrepreneurs know what climate disruption means for supplies, clients, and outputs. But they need support to prepare, guidance on investments, as well as financing, especially where solutions have high upfront costs.

        "While no two disasters are the same, we can do more today to increase preparedness, reduce impacts, and support a resilient recovery. Key actions can make a difference for the people and communities that are in the eye of natural disasters."
        Private companies and investors can support adaptation and resilience, investing, for example, in hurricane-proof houses, efficient irrigation, resilient micro-grids, and supply chains and logistics that limit the disruption when disasters hit. And they could innovate more: today, only 0.5 per cent of global patents are advancing climate adaptation and resilience. The key is to prepare national plans with market assessments that can crowd in the private sector.</p>
